# Transolver for PDE Solving

We evaluate [Transolver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02366) with six widely used PDE-solving benchmarks, which is provided by [FNO and GeoFNO](https://github.com/neuraloperator/neuraloperator).

**Transolver achieves 22% averaged relative promotion over the previous second-best model, presenting favorable efficiency and scalibility.**

## Get Started

1. Install Python 3.8. For convenience, execute the following command.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Prepare Data. You can obtain experimental datasets from the following links.


| Dataset       | Task                                    | Geometry        | Link                                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Elasticity    | Estimate material inner stress          | Point Cloud     | [[Google Cloud]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YBuaoTdOSr_qzaow-G-iwvbUI7fiUzu8) |
| Plasticity    | Estimate material deformation over time | Structured Mesh | [[Google Cloud]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YBuaoTdOSr_qzaow-G-iwvbUI7fiUzu8) |
| Navier-Stokes | Predict future fluid velocity           | Regular Grid    | [[Google Cloud]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UnbQh2WWc6knEHbLn-ZaXrKUZhp7pjt-) |
| Darcy         | Estimate fluid pressure through medium  | Regular Grid    | [[Google Cloud]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UnbQh2WWc6knEHbLn-ZaXrKUZhp7pjt-) |
| AirFoil       | Estimate airï¬‚ow velocity around airfoil | Structured Mesh | [[Google Cloud]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YBuaoTdOSr_qzaow-G-iwvbUI7fiUzu8) |
| Pipe          | Estimate fluid velocity in a pipe       | Structured Mesh | [[Google Cloud]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YBuaoTdOSr_qzaow-G-iwvbUI7fiUzu8) |

3. Train and evaluate model. We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts/`. You can reproduce the experiment results as the following examples:

```bash
bash scripts/Transolver_Elas.sh # for Elasticity
bash scripts/Transolver_Plas.sh # for Plasticity
bash scripts/Transolver_NS.sh # for Navier-Stokes
bash scripts/Transolver_Darcy.sh # for Darcy
bash scripts/Transolver_Airfoil.sh # for Airfoil
bash scripts/Transolver_Pipe.sh # for Pipe
```

 Note: You need to change the argument `--data_path` to your dataset path.

4. Develop your own model. Here are the instructions:

   - Add the model file under folder `./models/`.
   - Add the model name into `./model_dict.py`.
   - Add a script file under folder `./scripts/` and change the argument `--model`.

## Visualization

Transolver can handle PDEs under various geometrics well, such as predicting the future fluid and estimating the [[shock wave]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave) around airfoil.

## PDE Solving at Scale

To align with previous model, we only experiment with 8-layer Transolver in the main text. Actually, you can easily obtain a better performance by **scaling up Transolver**. The relative L2 generally decreases when we adding more layers.
